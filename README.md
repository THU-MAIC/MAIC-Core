MAIC (Massive AI-empowered Courses)  aims to create a highly immersive and configurable AI-powered learning classroom, built on large language models and incorporating multiple intelligent agents such as teachers, teaching assistants, and peers. This system is designed to assist students throughout the entire learning process, support teachers in intelligent lesson preparation, and enable high-level personalized learning for students, ultimately realizing an "autonomous classroom" experience where each student has their own tailored learning journey.

**Conceptual Design**: This project’s conceptual design encompasses both technological and educational philosophies:

*  **Technological Philosophy**: The project aspires to construct an intelligent classroom environment fully empowered by multi-agent systems based on large language models. It aims to significantly enhance students' immersive learning experiences while further strengthening intelligent assistance for teachers during lesson preparation, instruction, and post-class activities, thus facilitating the iterative evolution of intelligent learning environments.
* **Educational Philosophy**: Leveraging the powerful generalization capabilities of large language models, this project seeks to simultaneously address the dual challenge of balancing "scalability" and "personalization" in the digitization of education. The project aims to lead a paradigm shift in digital education for the new era, comparable to the transformation brought by large-scale classrooms in the past.
